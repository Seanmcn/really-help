# Really Help

Really Help is personal non-commercial project I'm currently working on which aims to force transparency on how
charities are spending the money donated to them.

I'm in the very early stages of just prototyping this out to see if it is even possible but so far it seems good.

Check out the [dev-notes.md](https://github.com/Seanmcn/really-help/blob/master/dev-notes.md) file to see
whats happening!
