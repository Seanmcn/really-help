Kind of burned out and finding it hard to actually get to the data processing side of this.

    - Category page useless, send to faceted search instead.
    - Going to get data from USA initially.
    - Need to build admin area to input basic info about charity and then start harvest of data.
    - Zero idea on how I'm actually going to programatically work through these PDF's and store as records right now.
      Need a way to store that will work for any country rather than jusdt being USA/Form 990 specific.

I've realised that just getting IRS 990s while okay is not perfect as most organisations operate in multiple countries so
not all their income & spending is reflected in just the IRS 990. So now I'm going to proceed with initially using the 990's but
will have to get global data alot sooner than anticipated.
